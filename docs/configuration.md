```

## Footer content

```yaml
# Footer content
# appears at the bottom of every page's main content
# Note: The footer_content option is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. 
# Please use `_includes/footer_custom.html` for more robust markup / liquid-based content.
footer_content: "Copyright &copy; 2017-2021 Patrick Marsceill."

# License information
# Provide license information for the project. License data is provided in list
# format, so that multiple licenses may be included.
# NOTE: By default, description text will be "[site title] is licensed under the"
license:
  - description: 
    name: "MIT License"
    url: "https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt" 

# Footer logos
# Specify one or more linked logos to display.
footer_logos:
  - name: "Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology"
    image: "/assets/images/logo_lsp_white.svg"
    url: "https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/"
  - name: "Harvard Medical School"  # the institution the logo represents

gh_edit_link: true # show or hide edit this page link
gh_edit_link_text: "Edit this page on GitHub."
gh_edit_repository: "https://github.com/labsyspharm/just-the-docs-lsp" # the github URL for your repo
gh_edit_branch: "main" # the branch that your docs is served from
# gh_edit_source: docs # the source that your files originate from
gh_edit_view_mode: "tree" # "tree" or "edit" if you want the user to jump into the editor immediately
```

_note: `footer_content` is deprecated, but still supported. For a better experience we have moved this into an include called `_includes/footer_custom.html` which will allow for robust markup / liquid-based content._

- the "page last modified" data will only display if a page has a key called `last_modified_date`, formatted in some readable date format
- `last_edit_time_format` uses Ruby's DateTime formatter; see examples and more information [at this link.](https://apidock.com/ruby/DateTime/strftime)
- `gh_edit_repository` is the URL of the project's GitHub repository
- `gh_edit_branch` is the branch that the docs site is served from; defaults to `master`
- `gh_edit_source` is the source directory that your project files are stored in (should be the same as [site.source](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/))
- `gh_edit_view_mode` is `"tree"` by default, which brings the user to the github page; switch to `"edit"` to bring the user directly into editing mode

## Color scheme

```yaml
# Color scheme supports "light" (default), "blue", "bold", and "dark"
color_scheme: blue
```
<button class="btn btn-primary js-toggle-blue-scheme">Preview blue color scheme</button>

<script>
const toggleBlueScheme = document.querySelector('.js-toggle-blue-scheme');

jtd.addEvent(toggleBlueScheme, 'click', function(){
  if (jtd.getTheme() === 'blue') {
    jtd.setTheme('light');
    toggleBlueScheme.textContent = 'Preview blue color scheme';
  } else {
    jtd.setTheme('blue');
    toggleBlueScheme.textContent = 'Return to light color scheme (default)';
  }
});
</script>

See [Customization]({% link docs/customization.md %}) for more information.

## Google Analytics

```yaml
# Google Analytics Tracking (optional)
# e.g, UA-1234567-89
ga_tracking: UA-5555555-55
ga_tracking_anonymize_ip: true # Use GDPR compliant Google Analytics settings (true by default)
```

## Document collections

By default, the navigation and search include normal [pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).
Instead, you can also use [Jekyll collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) which group documents semantically together.

For example, put all your documentation files in the `_docs` folder and create the `docs` collection:
```yaml
# Define Jekyll collections
collections:
  # Define a collection named "docs", its documents reside in the "_docs" directory
  docs:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true

just_the_docs:
  # Define which collections are used in just-the-docs
  collections:
    # Reference the "docs" collection
    docs:
      # Give the collection a name
      name: Documentation
      # Exclude the collection from the navigation
      # Supports true or false (default)
      nav_exclude: false
      # Exclude the collection from the search
      # Supports true or false (default)
      search_exclude: false
```

You can reference multiple collections.
This creates categories in the navigation with the configured names.
```yaml
collections:
  docs:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true
  tutorials:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true

just_the_docs:
  collections:
    docs:
      name: Documentation
    tutorials:
      name: Tutorials
```
